MYGAME2

It's a seckond try to create some game, mainly for programming training purposes.

This game should simulate a state. Well... there is no "game" at the moment, just some basic mechanics.

At the start there is a undeveloped society of a few people. People live, die, gave offsprings and work.
Through a work in some industry, industry can evolve. Who knows what will come later.
